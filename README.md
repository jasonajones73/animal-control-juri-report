# Animal Services Jurisdictional Report

This repository contains the code and output for a jurisdictional reporting prototype for our Animal Services division. Traditionally, our reporting has been compiled to PDF documents and published to our website. You can find those reports here - [Reports of Animal Control Services](https://www.guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-control/reports-of-animal-control-services).

In an effort to provide more robust and appropriately segmented information, this prototype was created using the `bookdown` R package. You can find more information on this package here - [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).

This prototype is deployed with automatic updating to Netlify and currently running here - [Animal Control Report Prototype](https://keen-bhaskara-86fddc.netlify.com/)
